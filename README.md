Bangalore House Price Predictor
This project is a complete end-to-end machine learning application that predicts house prices in Bangalore using real estate data sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset & Objective:
I used a real estate dataset containing details about house listings in Bangalore. The goal was to:

Clean and preprocess the data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Build regression models to predict house prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Machine Learning:
Several machine learning algorithms were tested, including:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

After evaluating their performance, Linear Regression was selected as the best-performing model and used for final deployment.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pickle

Deployment: The model is integrated into a Flask API which serves predictions to the frontend.
