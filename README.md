# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project predicts Bangalore house prices using a Kaggle dataset. After data cleaning and model training, Linear Regression was chosen for its accuracy. A Flask-powered web app with HTML, CSS, and JS lets users input location, BHK, bathrooms, and area to get the estimated price.
